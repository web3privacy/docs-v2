## Our Mission

> To drive profound social and political change by advocating for privacy in the Web3 Era.

Our primary goal is to empower individuals by restoring their agency in our hyperconnected reality. We produce and curate knowledge, ensuring that awareness of data privacy and security becomes a lifelong educational journey for everyone.

## Our Vision

_We envision a world where privacy is a conscious, actively chosen lifestyle, accessible to everyone, everywhere._

This is the future we are building toward. It's a world where the systems we use are designed to protect the vulnerable, not to exploit them, and where digital sovereignty is the default, not a feature.

### Our Three-Pillar Approach

To achieve our mission, we focus our energy on three interconnected pillars:

#### 1. Advocacy
We facilitate education through master classes, lectures, and guides. We engage with journalists, institutions, and researchers to elevate the conversation, and we work to establish ethical guidelines and best practices for the entire industry.

#### 2. Collaboration
We foster a vibrant community focused on Web3 privacy. We organize hackathons and events, contribute to industry reports, and bridge the gap between traditional data experts and Web3 leaders to enhance knowledge sharing.

#### 3. Tooling
We champion and support the products, services, and open-source initiatives that prioritize privacy. We advocate for a user-centered, humanistic approach to design and back the cutting-edge R&D that advances privacy-preserving technologies.

This is our shared map. If this mission resonates with you, you are in the right place. Welcome.
