title: Guilds

Guilds (or "Internal Working Groups") are the recognized, operational teams that form the backbone of the Web3Privacy Now community. They are responsible for maintaining our shared infrastructure, managing core processes, and ensuring the smooth day-to-day functioning of the ecosystem.

Unlike [Recognized Ecosystem Projects](/ecosystem/recognized-projects), which are independent initiatives that W3PN supports, Working Groups are internal teams focused on core organizational functions. **They are the public service departments of our digital community.**
