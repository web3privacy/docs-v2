## What Happens at an Assembly?

While each event has a unique agenda, they generally share a common structure that reflects our values:

*   **Working Sprints:** The majority of time is dedicated to hands-on work in small, focused groups, empowering members to take ownership and make tangible progress.
*   **Workshops & Discussions:** Sessions designed to brainstorm new ideas, solve strategic challenges, or share knowledge, embodying our principle of collaborative learning.
*   **Shared Experiences:** Beyond work, the agenda includes communal meals, social activities, and local exploration. These moments are essential for building the trust and respect that our Constitution is built upon.
