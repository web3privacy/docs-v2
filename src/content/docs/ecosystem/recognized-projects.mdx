title: Recognized Ecosystem Projects
description: A showcase of independent, mission-aligned projects supported by the Web3Privacy Now community.

Our mission is too big for any single organization to tackle alone. We succeed by fostering a constellation of independent, mission-aligned projects that drive innovation in specialized areas.

This page serves as the directory for these **Recognized Ecosystem Projects**. These are initiatives that, while operationally independent, have been formally endorsed by the W3PN community for their commitment to our shared mission and values.

## Getting Your Project Recognized

Do you have a project that advances the mission of Web3Privacy Now? Getting it formally recognized creates a powerful bridge to the ecosystem's resources and community support.

Recognition is not a requirement to exist — our Do-ocracy empowers anyone to start building. Instead, this is a formal process for established initiatives to request deeper integration.

### The Process

Becoming a Recognized Ecosystem Project is achieved via the [Formal Proposal](/governance/proposals) process. Your proposal will need to demonstrate that your project meets the following criteria.

#### Proposal Criteria

1.  **Mission and Cultural Alignment:** Your project must directly advance the W3PN mission and operate in a manner consistent with the spirit of the **[Guidelines (Section 8)](https://web3privacy.github.io/constitution/#guidelines)** within our [constitution](/constitution).
2.  **Alignment with Open Principles:** Your project must demonstrate a good-faith commitment to transparency and open-source development, in line with our community’s core values.
3.  **Operational Independence:** Your project must have its own brand and leadership. It is not a core asset of W3PN, but a distinct entity we support.

### Benefits of Recognition

Achieving "Recognized" status grants your project two key merits:

*   **Access to Shared Resources:** Your project is empowered to submit Formal Proposals to request support, including budget allocations from the W3PN treasury.
*   **A Formal Pathway to Membership:** Your contributors' work is formally valued as **demonstrable contribution** towards earning full W3PN Membership, giving them a voice in our collective governance.

> **What's the difference between a Working Group and an Ecosystem Project?**
>
> **Working Groups** are *internal* teams that run the core operations of W3PN itself (like the [Infra Guild](/ecosystem/working-groups/infra)). **Ecosystem Projects** are *independent* initiatives with their own missions that W3PN formally supports.
