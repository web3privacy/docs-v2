title: Shared Infrastructure & Services
description: A guide to the shared tools, platforms, and resources available to the W3PN community.
---

To support our work, Web3Privacy Now maintains a suite of shared technical resources. This infrastructure is a public good, designed to empower our members, working groups, and ecosystem projects by providing the tools we need to collaborate effectively and securely.

This page serves as the official catalog for all centrally managed services.

---

### Managed by the Infrastructure Guild

The stability, security, and accessibility of this infrastructure are the primary responsibility of the **[Infrastructure Guild](/ecosystem/working-groups/infra)**. They are the guardians of our digital commons.

**For support requests** or to report an issue with any of these services, please visit the [`#infra`](https://commons.w3pn.org/#narrow/stream/infra) channel on Commons.

## Requesting Access or New Services

Our infrastructure is designed to serve the needs of the community.

#### Requesting Access to an Existing Service

If you or your project need access to a managed resource (like web hosting), please make a request in the [`#infra`](https://commons.w3pn.org/#narrow/stream/infra) channel. A member of the Infrastructure Guild will assist you.

#### Proposing a New Shared Service

If you believe W3PN should adopt a new tool or platform as a shared resource (for example, a new design tool or a different cloud provider), this requires community consent. You should:

1.  Socialize the idea in [`#infra`](https://commons.w3pn.org/#narrow/stream/infra) to gather technical feedback.
2.  Submit a **[Formal Proposal](/governance/proposals)** outlining the rationale, costs, and benefits to the community.

### Your Responsibility

These are shared resources. By using them, you agree to follow our **[Security Best Practices](./security-best-practices.md)** and act as a responsible steward of our digital commons.
