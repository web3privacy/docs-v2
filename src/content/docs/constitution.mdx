Our constitution is a living framework, not a set of rigid laws. It is designed to empower contributors, protect our shared mission, and ensure our ecosystem can grow in a way that is fair and transparent.

Below is a summary of its core components to help you understand its structure.

## Key Concepts at a Glance

| Concept | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- |

| **Membership** | The process by which contributors earn formal governance rights. |

## Amending the Constitution

This is a living document designed to evolve with the community. All amendments must follow the formal, transparent process outlined in the [Constitution GitHub repository](https://github.com/web3privacy/constitution).

The process involves three key steps:

1.  **Public Discussion:** An idea is first discussed on our **[community forum](https://commons.w3pn.org/)** to gather feedback and refine the proposal.
2.  **Pull Request:** The specific changes are codified in a **[Pull Request](https://github.com/web3privacy/constitution/pulls)**, which serves as the technical specification for the amendment.
3.  **Formal Proposal:** The change is proposed on via a **Formal Proposal** which links to both the forum discussion and the Pull Request. The PR is only merged after the proposal has been successfully passed by the community.
