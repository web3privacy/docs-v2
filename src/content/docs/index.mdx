This is the canonical documentation for the [Web3Privacy Now](https://web3privacy.info) community. It is a living resource designed to be a practical guide to our principles, processes, and projects.

Our community operates on the principle of Intentional Do-ocracy â€” a framework that empowers individuals to act while ensuring our collective work is transparent and impactful. This documentation site is the key to understanding and participating in that system.
