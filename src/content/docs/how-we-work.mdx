> Our Philosophy: Action Over Bureaucracy

This page explains our core operating system: **Intentional Do-ocracy**.

Unlike traditional organizations that can be slowed down by meetings and top-down approvals, we are a community built for action. We believe that the best way to advance our mission is to empower every member to take initiative, build what they believe is valuable, and contribute freely.

This philosophy is about a mindful and structured approach to getting things done. It's a system designed to replace permission with trust and accountability.

## Intentional Do-ocracy

Our entire workflow is built on a five-stage process. This is the mental model you should use for any project, big or small.

**DREAM → DESIGN → DECIDE → ACT → REFLECT**

### 1. Dream: Take the Initiative

You are empowered to make things happen. If you see a problem that needs solving or have an idea for a new project, you have the agency to start. You do not need to ask for permission to begin exploring an idea.

### 2. Design: Think It Through

Before you act, take a moment to plan.
*   For a **small task**, this might just be a few seconds of thought.
*   For a **larger project**, this might involve drafting a brief plan, creating a sketch, or starting a discussion in a community channel to gather initial feedback from others.

This step encourages thoughtful action and helps prevent wasted effort.

### 3. Decide: Commit to Action

Commit to a course of action. For most things, this is a personal decision to move forward. For initiatives that will require significant community resources or have irreversible consequences, this stage involves [creating a Formal Proposal](/governance/proposals) to ensure community alignment.

### 4. Act: Do the Work

This is where the plan becomes reality. You build the thing, write the article, organize the event, or fix the bug. This is the heart of the "Do-ocracy"—the person doing the work has the authority over that work.

### 5. Reflect: Share Your Outcome

This final step is critical. Once your work is done, share it with the community.
*   Announce what you did.
*   Explain why you did it.
*   Share the outcome, linking to your work.

This builds trust, creates a culture of transparency, and allows the entire community to learn from both your successes and failures. It turns individual actions into collective wisdom.

### The Spirit and The Letter

The principles on this page describe our day-to-day culture and the "spirit" of how we operate. These concepts are formally defined and serve as the foundation for our governance.

For a complete understanding of our formal rules, including the specific definitions for proposals, membership, and our shared resources, please refer to our foundational document: **[The Constitution](/constitution)**.
