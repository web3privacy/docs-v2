title: The Path to Membership
description: How to earn a formal voice and governance rights in the Web3Privacy Now ecosystem.

In our community, we distinguish between **Supporters** — who are vital to our mission — and formal **Members**. Membership is a recognition of sustained, meaningful contribution. It grants you a formal voice in our governance and a tangible stake in our collective success.

This page outlines the transparent, merit-based process for becoming a W3PN Member.

### Membership is Earned, Not Given

There is only one way to become a Member: by demonstrating your value to the ecosystem through your work. Membership cannot be bought or granted as a favor. It is a recognition of trust and responsibility that you earn through your actions.

The path involves four clear steps.

### Step 1: Contribute and Create Value

This is the most important requirement. Before you can be nominated, you need a clear, public track record of contributing to the W3PN mission.

"Demonstrable contribution" can take many forms, including:

*   **Leading an initiative** through the full "Intentional Do-ocracy" cycle.
*   **Making consistent, high-quality contributions** to another project (e.g., code, design, research, event organization).
*   **Actively and constructively participating** in community discussions and governance over an extended period.
*   **Doing valuable work within a [Recognized Ecosystem Project](/ecosystem/recognized-projects)**. Contributions to these independent projects are explicitly valued as contributions to the entire W3PN mission.

### Step 2: Earn a Public Nomination

Once you have a track record of contribution, an existing W3PN Member must formally nominate you.

This happens in a public channel (like **[#governance](link-to-zulip-channel)** on Zulip). The nomination must include a brief summary of your contributions, ideally with links to specific examples of your work (e.g., GitHub commits, published articles, projects managed).

### Step 3: Community Consent (Lazy Consensus)

Your nomination is then open for a **72-hour review period**. During this time, other Members can review your track record.

This process follows our "Lazy Consensus" model:
*   **If no formal objections are raised**, the nomination is considered approved by the community. Silence equals consent.
*   An objection must be based on a belief that the candidate has not met the contribution criteria or does not align with our **[Shared Guidelines](/link/to/constitution/guidelines)**.

### Step 4: Steward Confirmation

After the review period passes without objection, the **[Stewards](/governance/stewards-conflict-resolution)** perform the final administrative act of confirming your new status and granting you access to any members-only channels or resources.

### Rights and Responsibilities of a Member

Becoming a Member grants you both new powers and new responsibilities within the ecosystem.

| You Gain the Right To... | You Accept the Responsibility To... |
| :--- | :--- |
| **Create a Formal Proposal** | Act in good faith and uphold the Constitution. |
| **Formally object to a proposal** | Actively foster a healthy and collaborative environment. |
| **Participate in the election of Stewards** | Use your governance rights thoughtfully and respectfully. |
| **Participate in the Contributor Rewards system** | Help nurture and guide new contributors. |

This system ensures that those who have the most influence in our governance are those who have proven their commitment to our shared mission.
