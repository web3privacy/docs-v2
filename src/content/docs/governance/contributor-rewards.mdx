title: Contributor Rewards
description: How we retroactively thank active members for their valuable contributions to the ecosystem.
---

To sustain our community, we believe it is essential to support our most active contributors. The Contributor Rewards system is our formal process for retroactively rewarding **[W3PN Members](/path/to/membership-page)** for the valuable work they have already completed.

This system is not for funding future projects. Its sole purpose is to be a tangible "thank you" that recognizes and rewards the valuable contributions of individuals, trusting them to continue creating impact.

## How It Works: A Quick Overview

The system operates in regular cycles, which we call "Funding Epochs" (e.g., once per quarter). The process has four simple steps.

1.  **The Funding Pool:** A specific amount of funds from the W3PN treasury is allocated to the rewards pool for the Epoch.
2.  **The Allocation Phase:** Every W3PN Member receives 100 non-financial "Allocation Points" to distribute among their peers (you cannot allocate points to yourself). A brief, public justification must be provided for each allocation.
3.  **The Weighted Calculation:** This is the crucial step. A member's "influence" in the allocation process is directly tied to the value of their own contributions during the Epoch. Allocations from members who were themselves highly recognized by the community carry more weight.
4.  **Distribution:** The funding pool is distributed to Members in proportion to their final, reputation-weighted scores.

## The Calculation Explained

The system uses a two-pass calculation to amplify the signal from active, recognized contributors.

| Step | Action | Purpose |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **A: Raw Score** | First, we sum the raw Allocation Points each member receives. | To get an initial measurement of who the community values. |
| **B: Allocator Weight** | We determine the "weight" of each allocator based on their own Raw Score. | To give more influence to the opinions of those who were themselves highly valued. |
| **C: Final Score** | We recalculate the scores, multiplying the points received by the allocator's weight. | To get a final, reputation-weighted score for each member. |

## A Practical Example

Let’s imagine a simplified W3PN with four members and a **$10,000** funding pool.

*   **Alice** (core contributor) gives: 100 points to Bob.
*   **Bob** (regular contributor) gives: 70 to Alice, 30 to Carol.
*   **Carol** (occasional contributor) gives: 80 to Alice, 20 to Bob.
*   **David** (inactive member) gives: 100 to Alice.

#### Phase 1: Raw Scores

| Recipient | Points From Alice | Points From Bob | Points From Carol | Points From David | **Raw Score** |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Alice | (self) | 70 | 80 | 100 | **250** |
| Bob | 100 | (self) | 20 | 0 | **120** |
| Carol | 0 | 30 | (self) | 0 | **30** |
| David | 0 | 0 | 0 | (self) | **0** |

#### Phase 2: Weighted Calculation

We use the Raw Scores as weights for each allocation.

*   Alice's Final Score: `(70 * 120)` (from Bob) `+ (80 * 30)` (from Carol) `+ (100 * 0)` (from David) = **10,800**
*   Bob's Final Score: `(100 * 250)` (from Alice) `+ (20 * 30)` (from Carol) = **25,600**
*   Carol's Final Score: `(30 * 120)` (from Bob) = **3,600**
*   David's Final Score: **0**

#### Phase 3: Final Payout

| Member | Final Score | % of Total | Payout |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| Alice | 10,800 | 27% | $2,700 |
| Bob | 25,600 | 64% | $6,400 |
| Carol | 3,600 | 9% | $900 |
| David | 0 | 0% | $0 |

> **Why did David’s allocation have no impact?**
> This is a core feature of the system. Because David was inactive and received 0 points himself, his "Allocator's Raw Score" was 0. The calculation `(100 * 0)` correctly gave his allocation zero weight. This demonstrates how the system automatically and transparently amplifies the signal from active, recognized contributors.

## Why This Weighted Model is Essential

*   **It Amplifies Signal, Reduces Noise:** It gives more weight to the opinions of members who are "in the trenches" and have the most context on who is creating value.
*   **Influence is Earned, Not Held:** A member's influence in the system is not static. It must be re-earned each Epoch through recognized work.
*   **It Creates a Virtuous Cycle:** Being recognized as a valuable contributor gives you a stronger voice in recognizing others, which reinforces and rewards expertise.
