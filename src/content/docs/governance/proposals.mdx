title: Making a Formal Proposal
description: Your guide to making collective decisions and committing shared community resources.
---

Our community operates on [Intentional Do-ocracy](/how-we-work), where any member is empowered to act. However, some decisions are too significant for one person to make alone. For these high-stakes actions, we use a **Formal Proposal**.

It is our primary tool for making collective decisions safely and transparently. It ensures that when we commit our shared resources — our time, our reputation, or our treasury — we do so with the clear consent of the community.

## When a Formal Proposal is Needed

As defined in Section 3 of our [constitution](/constitution), you should create a Formal Proposal for actions that involve:

*   **Committing significant community resources,** especially spending funds from the main W3PN treasury.
*   **Making fundamental changes** to our shared assets, like altering the W3PN brand or primary mission.
*   **Adopting official, long-term partnerships** with other organizations.
*   **Granting or revoking “Recognized Ecosystem Project” status.**
*   **Amending the Constitution** itself.
*   **Electing or removing Stewards.**

If your idea doesn't fall into one of these categories, you probably don't need a proposal — you can just do it!

## The Process: A Step-by-Step Guide

Follow these steps to ensure your proposal is well-received and has the best chance of success.

### Step 1: Socialize Your Idea (The "Design" Phase)

Before writing a formal proposal, discuss your idea informally in the relevant public [Commons stream](/communication-channels/#the-commons-our-asynchronous-hub) (e.g., [#governance](https://commons.w3pn.org/#narrow/stream/governance), [#infra](https://commons.w3pn.org/#narrow/stream/infra)). This is a crucial step to:
*   Gather initial feedback and refine your plan.
*   Find collaborators who believe in your idea.
*   Ensure that no one in the community is surprised when the formal proposal appears.

### Step 2: Write Your Proposal Using the Template

To ensure clarity and consistency, all proposals should follow a standard format. Copy the template below and fill in the details. Be clear, concise, and explain both *what* you want to do and *why* it's important.

### Step 3: Post in the `#proposals` Stream

Once your draft is ready, post it as a **new topic** in the **[#proposals](https://commons.w3pn.org/#narrow/stream/proposals)** stream on Commons. The title of your topic should be clear and descriptive (e.g., "Proposal: Establish a Community Grants Program").

## Proposal Template

Copy and paste the text below to start your proposal.

```markdown
### Formal Proposal: [Your Proposal Title]

**Proposer:** [Your Name/Handle]
**Date:** [Date of Submission]

**1. Summary:**
*A one-sentence summary of the proposal. What is the core action you are proposing?*

**2. Rationale:**
*Why is this proposal necessary? What problem does it solve or what opportunity does it create for W3PN? Provide context and your reasoning.*

**3. Action Items:**
*A clear, specific, and actionable list of what will be done if this proposal passes. If it involves spending funds, include the exact amount and the destination address.*
*   *Action Item 1*
*   *Action Item 2*
```

## What Happens Next: The Lazy Consensus Process

After you post your proposal, the 72-hour review period begins.

*   **If there are no objections:** Your proposal automatically passes. Silence equals consent. You are now empowered to carry out the action items.
*   **If a Member objects:** A formal objection (which must include a reason) triggers a dialogue. The goal is to discuss the concerns and find a compromise. If a compromise can't be reached, the issue can be escalated to the [Stewards](/governance/stewards-conflict-resolution).

This process ensures that while we default to action, we have a robust safety mechanism to prevent harm and ensure community alignment on our most important decisions.
