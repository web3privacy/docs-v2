title: Stewards & Conflict Resolution
description: Understanding the role of Stewards and the process for resolving community conflicts.
---

In a decentralized community, the health of our ecosystem depends on trust and mutual respect. However, passionate people will sometimes have profound disagreements. The **Stewards** are community members chosen for their wisdom and temperament to act as guardians of our constitution and impartial counselors in times of conflict.

This is not a traditional board of directors. Stewards do not set strategy or manage day-to-day activities. Their role is to **hold the space** so the community can thrive, acting as a trusted backstop for our most challenging situations.

## The Role of a Steward

As defined in our [constitution](/constitution), a Steward's responsibilities are strictly limited to two key functions:

#### 1. As Counselors: Conflict Resolution
When a significant interpersonal conflict arises that cannot be resolved directly between members, the Stewards act as impartial mediators. Their goal is not to assign blame or enact punishment, but to facilitate a constructive dialogue and find a mutually agreeable path forward. All such matters are handled with the utmost confidentiality.

#### 2. As Guardians: Principle & Asset Protection
Stewards are the ultimate guardians of the constitution.
*   **Veto Authority:** In the Formal Proposal process, their role is to act as the final check. They can only veto a proposal if it causes significant harm or directly violates our core principles.
*   **Asset Management:** They are the designated protectors of our communityâ€™s shared assets (like the treasury and domains), and can only execute transactions when instructed by a passed Formal Proposal.

### Powers and Limitations

To maintain a true Do-ocracy, the limits of Steward power are explicit.

| Stewards Have the Power To... | Stewards DO NOT Have the Power To... |
| :--- | :--- |
| Mediate escalated interpersonal disputes. | Dictate the mission or strategic direction of W3PN. |
| Uphold or overrule a Veto on a Formal Proposal. | Initiate or shut down projects started under Do-ocracy. |
| Invoke a "Steward Flag" to extend a proposal's review period. | Spend treasury funds without the explicit approval of a Formal Proposal. |
| Execute transactions when instructed by a passed proposal. | Influence the outcome of the Contributor Rewards system. |

## The Formal Conflict Resolution Process

Our community values direct resolution. However, when that isn't possible, there is a formal process.

#### Step 1: Direct Resolution is Always Preferred
If you have an issue with another member, the first step should always be a direct and respectful conversation with them. The Stewards are a final backstop for serious conflicts, not a first resort. Our **[Shared Guidelines](/link/to/guidelines)** provide a framework for these conversations.

#### Step 2: Escalation to the Stewards
If direct resolution fails or is not possible, any member can escalate the issue to the Stewards. You can do this by contacting any of the Stewards listed below privately.

#### Step 3: Mediation
The Stewards will then initiate a mediation process. They will listen to all parties involved, facilitate a constructive dialogue, and work to find a resolution that allows constructive collaboration to resume.
